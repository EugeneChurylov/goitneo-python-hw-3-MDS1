# goitneo-python-hw-3-MDS1
This project is the third and final homework of the course named Tier 1. Python programming: Foundations and Best Practices, created by GoIT Global School.
The project is a console bot, that can do the following:
  1. Add a contact by entering the command "add" in the console, followed by the name of the contact and their phone number of 10 digits;
  2. Change the phone number of the contact by entering the command "change" in the console, followed by the name of the contact and their new phone number;
  3. Show the phone number of a contact by entering the command "phone" and the contact`s name;
  4. Show all existing contacts with their phones (if present) and birthdays (if present);
  5. Remove a contact by entering the command "remove", followed by the name of the contact;
  6. Remove a phone number only by entering the command "delete-phone", followed by the name of the contact;
  7. Add a birthday to an existing contact, by entering the command "add-birthday" in the console, followed by the name of the contact and their birth date in the format of DD.MM.YYYY;
  8. Show the birth date of a contact by entering the command "show-birthday", followed by the name of the contact;
  9. Show all the contacts who will have their birthdays during the next week by entering the command "birthdays";
  10. Greet a user by entering the command "hello";
  11. Close the program by entering the command "close" or "exit".

The bot is case-insensitive, so do not worry, if you type your command or contact`s name in different cases.
The bot is checking for the wrong inputs, like unexisting commands, wrong date formats, length of phone numbers, or if you do not follow the order of instructions.
